## Introduction

Data Structures are containers that organize, group, and hold data or information. Data structures are unique and are suited for different purposes. This tutorial will cover three different data structures.

## Purpose of Data Structures

Data Structures are ways of organizing and storing data in a memory so that they can be accessed easily and worked with efficiently. Data Structures manage large amounts of data efficiently for uses of large databases. Efficient data structures are key to designing efficient algorithms. 

## Operations of Data Structures

There are different types of operations that can be performed for the manipulation of data in every data structure. Some operations are explained below:

* **Traversing**: Traversing a Data Structure means to visit the element stored in it. This can be done with any type of data structure.
* **Searching**: Searching means to find a particular element in the data structure. Searching is the operation which we can perform on data-structures like array, linked-list, tree, etc.
* **Insertion**: Insertion means to add an element in the given data structure. The insertion has the same name as an insertion in the data structure as an array, linked-list, tree, etc. In stack, this operation is called Push. In the queue, this operation is called Enqueue.
*  **Deletion**: Deletion means to delete an element in the given data structure. The deletion has the same name as a deletion in the data-structure as an array, linked-list, tree, etc. In stack, this operation is called Pop. In Queue this operation is called Dequeue.
