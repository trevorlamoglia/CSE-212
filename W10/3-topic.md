## Tree

Similar to linked lists, **Trees** are connected to multiple different nodes and are connected together by pointers. We will look at the following types of trees: **binary trees**, **binary search trees**, and **balanced binary search trees**

### Binary Tree

Binary Tree, a tree that links to no more than two **nodes**. In the picture below, the top node(red) is called the **root** node. The bottom nodes, nodes that do not connect to other nodes(green) are called **leaf** nodes. The node that has connected nodes (top blue) is called **parent** node. The node connected to the parent (bottom blue) are called **child** nodes.

Nodes that are left and right of any parent node form a **subtree**. There is always one root node in a tree.
